## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-21

### ‚ú® Added

- **Critical CSS Support**:
  - New support for inline critical CSS under `wwwroot/css/critical/`.
  - Multiple files are merged into a single `<style>` tag injected before all other bundles.
  - Graceful fallback for broken or malformed CSS files (logged, but not injected).

- **Improved Development Mode Behavior**:
  - Cache-busting enabled for local development via version query strings (e.g., `?v=timestamp`).
  - Minification disabled automatically when `isDevelopment` is true.

### üõ† Fixed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment Detection Bug**:
  - `AddDynamicBundle()` now accepts optional `IWebHostEnvironment` to correctly detect development/production modes.
  - If not supplied, it defaults to `isDevelopment = false` for backward compatibility.

### üìå Known Limitations

- ‚ùå **Custom asset folder paths** are not yet configurable.
- ‚ùå **No configuration object or runtime overrides**‚Äîbehavior is static and convention-bound.

### üõ£ Roadmap

Planned for `v2.0.0`:

- Configuration object support (`DynamicBundleConfig`)
- Customizable root paths (`JsRoot`, `CssRoot`, `CriticalCssRoot`)
- Fine-grained control over cache-busting, minification, and diagnostics
- Razor directives for override support
- Critical JS injection
- DevTools diagnostics page
